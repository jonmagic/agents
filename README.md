# Agents

These are the "agents" that I use on a daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly/yearly basis to help me manage my life and work. They are simply prompts that describe a goal, how an agent should work, a process it should follow, and a set of tools it should use to accomplish the goal.

For the most part they are built around my belief that [collaborations are better than automations](https://jonmagic.com/posts/designing-collaborations-not-just-automations/) for heavy context tasks. So these agents are designed to work with me, to reduce the energy spent on manual data collection, organization, and summarization, so that I can focus on the higher level thinking and decision making that only I can do.

I have these agents aliased into my global `.github/agents` folder so that I can easily use them in any project I'm working in.
